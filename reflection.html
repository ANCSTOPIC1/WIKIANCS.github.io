        <p>Throughout this WIKI BLOG assignment, I was able to learn more in-depth on how a gyroscope is used in the aviation industry. The creation of gyroscopes has really widened the navigation and flight assistant capabilities of the aircraft's flight instruments to what we have today in the modernised generation.</p>
     	   <p>What has actually gotten me more interested in the design of the gyroscope is on how it is able to derive the position of the plane just by using a few gimbals and rings. I am glad to have contributed to this WIKI BLOG which has allowed me to understand the use of a gyroscope better.</p>

        <p>This wiki blog assignment has helped me to understand better about gyroscopes. The history behind it and how aircraft started using gyroscopes on aircraft to help improve the flight instrument. Beside that the technology now like out mobile phones and watches are also using gyroscope. The construction of the gyroscope is really interesting as when the rings rotate the gyroscope is able to stay upright without falling. </p>
     	   <p>Through this I learned that not only aircraft use the gyroscope and there are also many different kinds of gyroscope that are being used currently. With the team effort we all gain something from this wiki blog assignment and it will be beneficial for us in the future.</p>

        <p>This wiki project has expanded my knowledge of the uses on the gyroscope in the aircraft, such as the instrumentation and avionics system like the heading indicator, turn coordinator and also the attitude indicator. It also amazed me on how a gyroscope design can be so simple with just a few gimbals and rings and it is able to derive the position of the aircraft.</p>
     	   <p>Beside that, I was able to explore how to create a website using HTML and CSS codes for this wiki project, which was a fun experience as I got to play around with the code to create a website for our needs. </p>

        <p>Through this project, I was able to discover that there are many different types of gyroscope each with its own pros and cons. It led me to further research on the theory and application of the fundamentals of gyroscopic precession. Concepts such as fibre optic gyroscopes sound absurd and impossible but are widely used in aviation. It is undeniable that gyroscope technology is still at its infancy with MEMS gyroscope still developing for aviation use. It could be a huge game changer once breakthrough for MEMS technology is realized. This effectively brings down fuel cost and increased storage capacity.</p>
     	   <p>Apart from learning about gyroscopes through this project. I was also able to take this opportunity to learn about MEMS gyroscope for practical usages in personal projects such as integrating it together with an arduino board as well. It was a rather interesting side project to work on, which taught me  quite a lot on the working principles of gyroscopes.</p>
